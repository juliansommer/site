# Site

This project is my personal site which uses Next.js with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

# Goals

- Performance was a big consideration for this project. I wanted to make sure that the site was as fast as possible. This means utilise server components unless client components are absolutely necessary, try and keep the bundle size as small as possible and make sure the site is responsive. It also means no scroll animations so only the first load animation is used.
- SEO was also of importance, was a good learning experience for SEO basics and the Next.js metadata API (which I then applied at work). I think I did a pretty good job as if you search "Julian Sommer Australia" the site is the first result.

# TODO

- split experience and education into separate components
- potentially make the layout resemble resume more, so experience and education at top etc
