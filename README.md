# Site

This project is my personal site which uses Next.js with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

# Goals

- Performance was a big consideration for this project. I wanted to make sure that the site was as fast as possible. This means utilise server components unless client components are absolutely necessary, try and keep the bundle size as small as possible and make sure the site is responsive.
- SEO was also of importance, was a good learning experience for SEO basics and the Next.js metadata API (which I then applied at work). I think I did a pretty good job as if you search "Julian Sommer Australia" the site is the first result.

# TODO

- make the experience thing be in the centre when on less than md, on less than md it will put the dates at the top but this is currently aligned left
- add more animations - when u scroll to see the skills, will animate in. same for projects and experience.
- make footer go to max-6xl width to be the same as the nav bar
