# Site

This project is my personal site which uses Next.js with React, TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

# Goals

- Performance was a big consideration for this project. I wanted to make sure that the site was as fast as possible. This means no fancy animations and utilise server components where possible.
- SEO was also of importance, was a good learning experience for SEO basics and the Next.js metadata API (which I then applied at work). I think I did a pretty good job as if you search "Julian Sommer Australia" the site is the first result.

# TODO

- add more animations
- have /projects page and then /projects/[slug] page where it will have a detailed breakdown of the project. need a headless cms for that?
